# my socialist planning sim

I am building up a crude model of socialist economy

I am using Scheme because I just finished _The Structure and Interpretation
of Computer Programs_ and I want to keep trying it out. 

I am also reading Alec Nove's _The Economics of Feasible Socialism_. Although I am not ready to try to test out central planning versus market socialism, in the intial model I'm building the production units do send orders
to other production units in a decentralized manner.
